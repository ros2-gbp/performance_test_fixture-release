ros-jazzy-performance-test-fixture (0.2.1-2noble) noble; urgency=high

  * Fix a warning when building on Ubuntu Noble. (#26 <https://github.com/ros2/performance_test_fixture/issues/26>) (#27 <https://github.com/ros2/performance_test_fixture/issues/27>)
    In particular, gcc 13.2 was complaining that we were
    accessing a pointer after a free.  And that was technically
    true; the calls to DoNotOptimize(ptr) were after the
    free.  Just move this before the free (when the ptr is still
    valid) to remove the warning, but still ensure that we don't
    optimize the pointer away.
    (cherry picked from commit e406c3cf4a352ab3f89c43fcebe7503781be5905)
